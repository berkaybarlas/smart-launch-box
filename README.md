# smart-launch-box
An IoT project for diet tracking.


Project Description 

  The purpose of project was regulating and creating healthier eating order. Our solution was giving the user the data of what he/she ate, in other word tracking the eaten food. We made an smart box to collect data of food. Our system is understand food inside of box using image recognition and tracking weight and temperature with sensors. With the given data user can see what and  he/she eat. We used Raspberry Pi to use cloud technologies easily.
	
  Our system sends the collected data to cloud using Wifi. Then, Android application takes the data from cloud and shows the food, weight and temperature to user.
